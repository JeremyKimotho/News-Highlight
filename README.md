## Description
This is an application that allow a user to view news articles from various sources and read them on their corresponding website if desired. A news api is used which returns a list of the information that we need. We take the imahe, headline and a few other things and use it to construct an article object or dictionary that we then store in a list. This list is what we're displaying on the page.
